1. The 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars are 1. Safety & Security, 2. Clarity, 3. Approachability, 4. Developer Experience, and most importantly 5. Resource Oriented Programming.

2. The 5 Pillars 
Safety & Security prevents mistakes and ensures that the contracts do only what they are supposed to do.
Clarity makes reviewing the code efficient so that bugs can be tracked down more easily.
Approachability lowers the learning curve and decreases the time cost of using the technology.
Developer Experience makes is easier for developers to not make mistakes because they don't have to find a hacky way of doing things.
